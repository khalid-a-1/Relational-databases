    "\n",
    "In this query we are trying to find the average rating of all entries in every available year. We also record the total number of entries in each year as that may be useful. The required data can be acquired by joining the titles and ratings tables. Next, we need to group by the year so we can get the average rating of all entries in each year. Finally, we sort the data by year for convenience.\n",

This query contains a subquery to initially count the number of directors in each production by joining the titles and principles tables. The subquery specifically only includes people from the 'director' category and groups by the production. From this subquery, we group and order by the number of directors and count the number of entries in each group, thereby getting the number of productions for each number of directors.\n",

    "### Q1. Which genre in our IMDb data has the most ratings?\n",
    "\n",
    "We explore the relationship between the average ratings and different available genres for each of the entries in the IMDb Database by representing the statistics on a bar graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "We find that the most rated genre according to our IMDb Database is the documentary genre followed by animation which is further followed by history. The high ratings of the documentary genre can be due to people’s greater interest in real life events more than fiction. Animation can be explained by the audience being mostly adolescents, teens and young adults which makes that genre more preferable than the others. History can also be explained with the interest in past events by new or older generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lowest rated genre on our graph is horror. The horror genre targets a specific audience like teens or young adults which limits more to those who can actually sit through a horror movie. On the other hand, the highly rated genres target very broad audiences, which can explain the difference in ratings.\n",
    "<img src=\"genre_rating.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. Which years have the minimum and maximum average rated IMDb entries?\n",
    "\n",
    "We wanted to see how the average ratings are changing for the different entries over the years from 1878 to 2018. We explore the relationship using a line graph. We can see that the two extreme points for average ratings on our graph are for the years 1891, which had an average rating of 4.9, and 1902, which had an average rating of 8.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum rated year in our data shows that the only recorded rating we have for it is for the *Newark Athlete*, which is an American short silent film directed and produced by William Kennedy Dickson. The low ratings for it can be explained by it not having an interesting enough genre or it being an art form that is too complicated for the general population to understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum rated year in our data shows that the only recorded rating is for *A Trip to the Moon*, which is a French adventure film directed by Georges Méliès. The film was famous and had very high ratings because of the idea of going to the moon. The actual act of going to the moon had not really taken place yet and this movie was wild representation of what could happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason these two years were extreme points in the data was partially due to not having any other data in those years. Statistically speaking, the less data that is averaged, the more likely it is for the average to be farther away from other averages of similar data due to outliers. Since the two films were the only entries in their respective years, the average ended up being simply their own ratings, and thus more extreme than any other year listed.\n",
    "<img src=\"average_rating_by_year.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. How many directors does each entry in our IMDb data has?\n",
    "\n",
    "We wanted to see how many directors each of the IMDb entries usually have. It was an interesting graph to look at because we can see that 34,162 of the entries had only one director, for a total that is greater than all the other director counts summed up. We can see that the second most common number of directors is 2 directors, which has 1,941 IMDb entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "You cannot really see any other bars until you actually exclude the number of entries that have one or two directors only. After that we can see that the greatest number of directors an entry has is 6 for only 75 entries. (Go ahead and actually explore the data yourself by excluding data!) It is also interesting that there are more entries with 6 directors than with 4 or 5 directors, after there being so many entries with just 1 or 2 directors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that most entries have only one director is probably because people find it difficult to work with other people in a job that requires you to manage and be in control of how the final output is supported to look. Or maybe it is the fact that studios do not want to spend their budget on hiring more directors when they can spend that money on something that can help their production in some other way.\n",

    "### Q4. How long are the longest running programs on the IMDb Database and what are their names?\n",
    "\n",
    "We explored the longest running time of each IMDb entry by subtracting the start year from the end year. We represented this information using a bar graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The longest running program was *Guiding Light*, which had been airing for a total of 57 years. The second longest running programs are *Steptoe and Son* and *As the World Turns*, which each have been airing for 54 years. This is followed by *One Life to Live*, which had been on air for 45 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting fact is the entries that have the longest running are usually popular soap operas, kid TV shows, or sitcoms. There are also some wildly popular talk shows, for example *The Oprah Winfrey Show*, which was on for 27 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data leads us to the conclusion that these particular types of TV are popular forms of entertainment which led to the productions running for years.\n",
